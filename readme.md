# Citadel Website Project

This is a website to replace the website that's currently at [http://sfcitadel.org/][http://sfcitadel.org/]. The goals are to create a beautiful, mobily responsive website that explains the Citadel's mission, helps bring new kinksters into the community, and uses modern web design to create feelings of institution, cleanliness, and safety in order to increase traffic to the Citadel itself and improve its income.

#The Stack

This is a volunteer-based project run through the [Kinky Coders San Francisco][https://fetlife.com/groups/129661] group. Because we are encouraging as many new programmers as possible to use this as a practice project, we are keeping the stack simple for the time being. We use:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* Jquery

# The Design/ Tech Spec

Actual mockups are coming soon, but for the time being here is an outline.
The MVP is a single page application with a navbar full of anchor tags and a links to the erobay calendar (which we are getting access to the CSS at some point!) and a Citadel donation page on gofundme or something.

##Navbar:
A brand on the left, and anchored links on the right to...
* Visit The Citadel
* Calendar
* Contact

##Body:
The body is a bunch of full-width panels alternating between solid backgrounds and beatiful images of people being mean to each other.
