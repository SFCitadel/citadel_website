# Style Guide

We want to build a website that shows that the Citadel can be a fun and friendly space for the kinky community in SF. We want to:

 - Show the space
 - Show that it's a fun and friendly space!
 - Show that it strives to be an inclusive and welcoming space
 - Make it easy to understand where it is and what it is for
 - Provide newcomers to the scene with an understanding of what it's about
 - Convey the Citadel rules to all newcomers
 
We want to avoid:

 - Making the space seem dark or dim
 - Making the space seem exclusively 'hardcore' or exclusionary
 
## Visual language

Here are some rules for the visual language:

 - We want to match colors with the citadel space if possible:
  - Soft grays
  - Darker reds and blues
  - White as an accent
  
 - We want to avoid straight blacks; we want the website to be set up so that (necessarily darker) photos can contrast
 
## Visual Hierarchy

We want to be as close as possible to a single page app:

 - Bands of content that can be scrolled down, in order of importance
 - Interspersed with gorgeous full-width photos of the space
 
 

## Use of Color

## Content and Tone
