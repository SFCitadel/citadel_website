# Style Guide

We want to build a website that shows that the Citadel can be a fun and friendly space for the kinky community in SF. We want to:

 - Show the space
 - Make it easy to understand where it is and what it is for
 - ETC
 
We want to avoid:

 - Making the space seem dark or dim
 - ETC
 
To this end:

 - We want to avoid straight black or dark colors except for contrast
 - We want to match typography with the new logos
 - ETC.
